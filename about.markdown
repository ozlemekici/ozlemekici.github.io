   I am a Physics Engineer and Data Analyst. I also do a visualization with Power BI and Tableau. I studied and taught Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, and Electric-Electronics. I specialize in Python and Matlab. I have taught courses on programming at universities and international communities. I can work systematically with Git/Github. Also, I am good at working with different disciplines and teams.

So, if you want to hire me, you can provide it from [my upwork profile](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01550e7089fbce960f).
